1-nephi,1,13,LEHI,"Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen thine abominations!"
1-nephi,1,14,LEHI,"Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth, and, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall perish!"
1-nephi,2,1,LORD,"Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things which thou hast done; and because thou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the things which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life."
1-nephi,2,9,LEHI,"O that thou mightest be like unto this river, continually running into the fountain of all righteousness!"
1-nephi,2,10,LEHI,"O that thou mightest be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord!"
1-nephi,3,7,NEPHI,"I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them."
1-nephi,3,13,LABAN,"Behold thou art a robber, and I will slay thee."
1-nephi,3,29,ANGEL,"Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod? Know ye not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you, and this because of your iniquities? Behold ye shall go up to Jerusalem again, and the Lord will deliver Laban into your hands."
1-nephi,3,31,LAMANLEMUEL,"How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?"
1-nephi,4,10,NEPHI,Never at any time have I shed the blood of man.
1-nephi,4,11,SPIRIT,Behold the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands.
1-nephi,4,14,LORD,"Inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments, they shall prosper in the land of promise."
1-nephi,4,34,NEPHI,"Surely the Lord hath commanded us to do this thing; and shall we not be diligent in keeping the commandments of the Lord? Therefore, if thou wilt go down into the wilderness to my father thou shalt have place with us."
1-nephi,5,2,SARIAH,"Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness."
1-nephi,5,8,SARIAH,"Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons, and delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power whereby they could accomplish the thing which the Lord hath commanded them."
1-nephi,7,17,NEPHI,"O Lord, according to my faith which is in thee, wilt thou deliver me from the hands of my brethren; yea, even give me strength that I may burst these bands with which I am bound."
1-nephi,10,8,FUTUREJOHNTHEBAPTIST,"Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for there standeth one among you whom ye know not; and he is mightier than I, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose."
1-nephi,11,2,SPIRIT,"Behold, what desirest thou?"
1-nephi,11,3,NEPHI,I desire to behold the things which my father saw.
1-nephi,11,4,SPIRIT,Believest thou that thy father saw the tree of which he hath spoken?
1-nephi,11,5,NEPHI,"Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words of my father."
1-nephi,11,8,SPIRIT,Look!
1-nephi,11,9,NEPHI,I behold thou hast shown unto me the tree which is precious above all.
1-nephi,11,10,SPIRIT,What desirest thou?
1-nephi,11,11,NEPHI,To know the interpretation thereof
1-nephi,11,12,SPIRIT,Look!
1-nephi,11,14,SPIRIT,"Nephi, what beholdest thou?"
1-nephi,11,15,NEPHI,"A virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins."
1-nephi,11,16,SPIRIT,Knowest thou the condescension of God?
1-nephi,11,17,NEPHI,"I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things."
1-nephi,11,18,SPIRIT,"Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh."
1-nephi,11,19,SPIRIT,Look!
1-nephi,11,21,SPIRIT,"Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father! Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?"
1-nephi,11,22,NEPHI,"Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things."
1-nephi,11,23,SPIRIT,"Yea, and the most joyous to the soul."
1-nephi,11,24,SPIRIT,Look!
1-nephi,11,26,SPIRIT,Look and behold the condescension of God!
1-nephi,11,30,SPIRIT,Look!
1-nephi,11,31,SPIRIT,Look!
1-nephi,11,35,SPIRIT,"Behold the world and the wisdom thereof; yea, behold the house of Israel hath gathered together to fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
1-nephi,11,36,SPIRIT,"Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb."
1-nephi,12,1,SPIRIT,"Look, and behold thy seed, and also the seed of thy brethren."
1-nephi,12,8,SPIRIT,"Behold the twelve disciples of the Lamb, who are chosen to minister unto thy seed."
1-nephi,12,11,SPIRIT,Look!
1-nephi,12,11,SPIRIT,"These are made white in the blood of the Lamb, because of their faith in him."
1-nephi,12,14,SPIRIT,"Behold thy seed, and also the seed of thy brethren."
1-nephi,12,22,SPIRIT,Behold these shall dwindle in unbelief.
1-nephi,13,1,SPIRIT,Look!
1-nephi,13,2,SPIRIT,What beholdest thou?
1-nephi,13,2,NEPHI,I behold many nations and kingdoms.
1-nephi,13,3,SPIRIT,These are the nations and kingdoms of the Gentiles.
1-nephi,13,5,SPIRIT,"Behold the formation of a church which is most abominable above all other churches, which slayeth the saints of God, yea, and tortureth them and bindeth them down, and yoketh them with a yoke of iron, and bringeth them down into captivity."
1-nephi,13,11,SPIRIT,Behold the wrath of God is upon the seed of thy brethren.
1-nephi,13,21,SPIRIT,Knowest thou the meaning of the book?
1-nephi,13,22,NEPHI,I know not.
1-nephi,13,23,SPIRIT,Behold it proceedeth out of the mouth of a Jew.
1-nephi,13,23,SPIRIT,"The book that thou beholdest is a record of the Jews, which contains the covenants of the Lord, which he hath made unto the house of Israel; and it also containeth many of the prophecies of the holy prophets; and it is a record like unto the engravings which are upon the plates of brass, save there are not so many; nevertheless, they contain the covenants of the Lord, which he hath made unto the house of Israel; wherefore, they are of great worth unto the Gentiles."
1-nephi,13,33,LORD,"I will be merciful unto the Gentiles, unto the visiting of the remnant of the house of Israel in great judgment."
1-nephi,13,34,LORD,"after I have visited the remnant of the house of Israel -- and this remnant of whom I speak is the seed of thy father -- wherefore, after I have visited them in judgment, and smitten them by the hand of the Gentiles, and after the Gentiles do stumble exceedingly, because of the most plain and precious parts of the gospel of the Lamb which have been kept back by that abominable church, which is the mother of harlots,"
1-nephi,13,34,LORD,"I will be merciful unto the Gentiles in that day, insomuch that I will bring forth unto them, in mine own power, much of my gospel, which shall be plain and precious"
1-nephi,14,7,LORD,For the time cometh
1-nephi,14,7,LORD,"that I will work a great and a marvelous work among the children of men; a work which shall be everlasting, either on the one hand or on the other -- either to the convincing of them unto peace and life eternal, or unto the deliverance of them to the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds unto their being brought down into captivity, and also into destruction, both temporally and spiritually, according to the captivity of the devil, of which I have spoken."
1-nephi,14,8,SPIRIT,Rememberest thou the covenants of the Father unto the house of Israel?
1-nephi,14,8,NEPHI,Yea.
1-nephi,14,9,SPIRIT,"Look, and behold that great and abominable church, which is the mother of abominations, whose founder is the devil."
1-nephi,14,10,SPIRIT,"Behold there are save two churches only; the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the devil; wherefore, whoso belongeth not to the church of the Lamb of God belongeth to that great church, which is the mother of abominations; and she is the whore of all the earth."
1-nephi,14,18,SPIRIT,Look!
1-nephi,15,7,LAMANLEMUEL,"Behold, we cannot understand the words which our father hath spoken concerning the natural branches of the olive-tree, and also concerning the Gentiles."
1-nephi,15,8,NEPHI,Have ye inquired of the Lord?
1-nephi,15,9,LAMANLEMUEL,We have not; for the Lord maketh no such thing known unto us.
1-nephi,15,11,LORD,"If ye will not harden your hearts, and ask me in faith, believing that ye shall receive, with diligence in keeping my commandments, surely these things shall be made known unto you."
1-nephi,15,18,LORD,In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
1-nephi,15,21,LAMANLEMUEL,What meaneth this thing which our father saw in a dream? What meaneth the tree which he saw?
1-nephi,15,22,NEPHI,It was a representation of the tree of life.
1-nephi,15,23,LAMANLEMUEL,"What meaneth the rod of iron which our father saw, that led to the tree?"
1-nephi,15,26,LAMANLEMUEL,What meaneth the river of water which our father saw?
1-nephi,15,31,LAMANLEMUEL,"Doth this thing mean the torment of the body in the days of probation, or doth it mean the final state of the soul after the death of the temporal body, or doth it speak of the things which are temporal?"
1-nephi,16,1,LAMANLEMUEL,"Thou hast declared unto us hard things, more than we are able to bear."
1-nephi,16,3,NEPHI,"And now my brethren, if ye were righteous and were willing to hearken to the truth, and give heed unto it, that ye might walk uprightly before God, then ye would not murmur because of the truth, and say: Thou speakest hard things against us."
1-nephi,16,23,NEPHI,Whither shall I go to obtain food?
1-nephi,16,26,LORD,"Look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written."
1-nephi,16,35,DAUGHTERSOFISHMAEL,"Our father is dead; yea, and we have wandered much in the wilderness, and we have suffered much affliction, hunger, thirst, and fatigue; and after all these sufferings we must perish in the wilderness with hunger."
1-nephi,17,7,LORD,"Arise, and get thee into the mountain."
1-nephi,17,8,LORD,"Thou shalt construct a ship, after the manner which I shall show thee, that I may carry thy people across these waters."
1-nephi,17,9,NEPHI,"Lord, whither shall I go that I may find ore to molten, that I may make tools to construct the ship after the manner which thou hast shown unto me?"
1-nephi,17,14,LORD,"After ye have arrived in the promised land, ye shall know that I, the Lord, am God; and that I, the Lord, did deliver you from destruction; yea, that I did bring you out of the land of Jerusalem."
1-nephi,17,48,NEPHI,"In the name of the Almighty God, I command you that ye touch me not, for I am filled with the power of God, even unto the consuming of my flesh; and whoso shall lay his hands upon me shall wither even as a dried reed; and he shall be as naught before the power of God, for God shall smite him."
1-nephi,17,53,LORD,"Stretch forth thine hand again unto thy brethren, and they shall not wither before thee, but I will shock them, saith the Lord, and this will I do, that they may know that I am the Lord their God."
1-nephi,17,55,LAMANLEMUEL,"We know of a surety that the Lord is with thee, for we know that it is the power of the Lord that has shaken us."
1-nephi,17,55,NEPHI,"I am thy brother, yea, even thy younger brother; wherefore, worship the Lord thy God, and honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God shall give thee."
1-nephi,18,10,LAMANLEMUEL,We will not that our younger brother shall be a ruler over us.
1-nephi,19,11,ZENOS,"The Lord God surely shall visit all the house of Israel at that day, some with his voice, because of their righteousness, unto their great joy and salvation, and others with the thunderings and the lightnings of his power, by tempest, by fire, and by smoke, and vapor of darkness, and by the opening of the earth, and by mountains which shall be carried up."
1-nephi,19,24,NEPHI,"Hear ye the words of the prophet, ye who are a remnant of the house of Israel, a branch who have been broken off; hear ye the words of the prophet, which were written unto all the house of Israel, and liken them unto yourselves, that ye may have hope as well as your brethren from whom ye have been broken off; for after this manner has the prophet written."
1-nephi,22,1,LAMANLEMUEL,"What meaneth these things which ye have read? Behold, are they to be understood according to things which are spiritual, which shall come to pass according to the spirit and not the flesh?"
1-nephi,22,9,GOD,In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
